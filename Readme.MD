# LinkedIn Extractor

Because manually copying 50 names and Googling them individually is nobody's idea of a good time.

## What It Does

- **Extracts profiles** from LinkedIn recommendations based on company name
- **Auto-generates search URLs** so Google does the heavy lifting
- **Filters for "Connect" users** only (because "Message" means you're already connected)
- **Exports to CSV/Excel** like a professional data scientist
- **Robust matching** handles company name chaos (Google, google, google.com, goo-gle... we got you)

## How to Use

3. Hit **Start Extraction** and let it work
4. Visit more profiles—it keeps collecting automatically
5. Download your networking goldmine as CSV or Excel
